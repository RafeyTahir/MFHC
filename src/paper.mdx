## Abstract

This work presents a **model-free control framework** for the generation of **stable limit cycles** in a class of **underactuated mechanical systems**. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on precise system models, the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the system dynamics and remains robust against parametric uncertainties and external disturbances.

The controller integrates adaptive mechanisms with nonlinear feedback to ensure convergence toward a desired periodic orbit while maintaining closed-loop stability. Rigorous theoretical guarantees are established using Lyapunov-based analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulation studies on representative underactuated mechanical systems, demonstrating reliable limit-cycle generation under uncertainty.

## Problem Setting

Underactuated mechanical systems are characterized by having fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom, making control design particularly challenging. Generating stable rhythmic motions in such systems is a fundamental problem in robotics and nonlinear control, with applications in locomotion, manipulation, and energy-efficient motion generation.

## Proposed Method

The proposed controller is designed in a **model-free** manner, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of inertia, Coriolis, or gravitational terms. Adaptive laws are introduced to compensate for unknown dynamics while ensuring boundedness of all closed-loop signals.

## Stability Analysis

Closed-loop stability and convergence to the desired limit cycle are proven using Lyapunov-based arguments. The analysis guarantees robustness with respect to modeling uncertainties and bounded disturbances.

## Simulation Results

Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed control framework successfully generates and stabilizes the desired limit cycle, even in the presence of significant uncertainty and disturbances.
